          Hello, this conversation is currently being "refined". That means,
          this prompt was already asked to an AI and an answer was received.

          The user is requesting that you "refine" the answer given by the
          prior AI conversation. Your goal is to review the prior answer,
          evaluate its accuracy. If you determine that some changes should be
          made, then adjust the answer and respond with the corrected version.
